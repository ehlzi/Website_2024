                <p class="about-description">
                    We live by a set of principles and values that guide us each day, and set us apart.
                    With them, we are able to provide our employees with a work environment where love and gratitude are the stars that guide us, creating an experience unlike any other we know of, and that is our goal.
                    After all, we are not just in the restaurant business, we are in the business of developing people.
                    Of all the successes we've found, we are most proud of the lives that have been changed through our communities and culture.

                <p class="description">
                    In April 2012, Dreux came to Venice, California as Executive Chef of Plant Bae in Southern California bringing his health-based,
                    flavor driven cuisine to a wider audience. He now oversees the culinary direction and development at all the restaurants in the region,
                    including Arts District, Larchmont Village, Venice, and San Diego.

                <p class="description">
                    Driven by her passion for wholesome nutrition and the mind-body connection, Jayne embarks on a mission to share her expertise with the plant-based community,
                    particularly the devoted following of Plant Bae. She recognizes the power of nourishing the body with nutrient-rich,
                    plant-based foods and seeks to inspire others to embrace this lifestyle with enthusiasm rather than obligation.
                    Jayne believes that nutrition should be a source of joy, not a burden, and she endeavors to make it accessible and enjoyable for everyone.
